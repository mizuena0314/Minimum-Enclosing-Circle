      <h1>Minimum Enclosing Circle using Simulated Annealing</h1>
      
      <p>
        The <strong>minimum enclosing circle</strong> is the smallest circle that contains all of a given set of points in the Euclidean plane.
        One solution to the problem of finding this circle is to use <em>simulated annealing</em>. 
      </p>

      <h2>Simulated Annealing</h2>
      <p>
        Put simply, simulated annealing is an <em>optimization technique</em>.
        We start with an initial solution to the problem and look for a nearby solution.
        If this nearby solution is better than our initial solution, we update our solution.
        We repeat this until we can find a &quot;good enough&quot; solution.
        <br><br/>
        The downfall of this method is that it is easy to fall into a local minimum trap,
        in which a seemingly optimal nearby solution is not actually globally optimal.
        However, we do not need to worry about ths in the minimum enclosing circle problem because
        <strong>distance functions are convex</strong>.
